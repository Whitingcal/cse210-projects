The project is simple to start. Run the program and type the name of the person as shown then you can add principles, invitations, and ordinances to it.

I wanted to have some more checks to keep from adding the same of each type more than once but due to finals I was a little restricted on time. It will have to be something I do on my own time after the semester ends.

I hope you enjoy!
